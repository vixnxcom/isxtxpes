Your favorite pair of shoes from when you were a kid—the ones your mom searched for until she got tired.

But then, you see something that shakes you to your core.
You see the <span className='aeon-bold text-[20px]'>business opportunity </span>you ignored because you thought it was too risky and people told you it wouldn't
work.
You see the money you could have made if only you had started earlier.
You see <span className='aeon-bold text-[20px]'> ₦3 million, ₦5 million,</span> even
 <span className='aeon-bold text-[20px'> ₦15 million,</span>  just sitting there—money
  that should have been in your account by
